This repository reproduces a bug of [koral--/jacoco-gradle-teskit-plugin](https://github.com/koral--/jacoco-gradle-testkit-plugin) with Gradle 6.5.

## Bug description

When executing `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` in this repository, the output contains:

```
> Task :jacocoTestReport
[ant:jacocoReport] Classes in bundle 'broken-testkit-coverage' do no match with execution data. For report generation the same class files must be used as at runtime.
[ant:jacocoReport] Execution data for class de/joshuagleitze/gradle/CoverageTestPlugin$apply$1 does not match.
[ant:jacocoReport] Execution data for class de/joshuagleitze/gradle/CoverageTestPlugin does not match.
[ant:jacocoReport] Execution data for class de/joshuagleitze/gradle/CoverageTestPlugin$apply$1$1 does not match.
```

and the coverage report shows 0% coverage.

This does not happen with the previous version of Gradle:

After executing `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 6.4.1`, `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` does _not_ have these lines in the output and the coverage report shows 100% coverage.

It also does not happen with Gradle 6.6:

After executing `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 6.6-rc-4`, `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` does _not_ have these lines in the output and the coverage report shows 100% coverage.


## Notes

This repository requires a Java version â‰¥ 9.
